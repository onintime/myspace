            MySpace.com and the Information We Collect</font></b></font><br>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MySpace.com is an online networking community that connects people through networks of friends. To accomplish this, our users create profiles that are shown to people in their personal network. A personal network consists of a user.s friends as well as the extended group of people that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. To help your MySpace.com experience, some personal information we request is displayed to people within these personal networks.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#FF6600">Invite A Friend</font></b></font><br>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. MySpace.com will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. MySpace.com stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. MySpace.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders, and notifications of member services (such as messages from other members). The friend may contact MySpace.com to request the removal of this information from our database.</font> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#FF6600">Information Collection and Use by MySpace.com</font></b></font><br><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MySpace.com collects account information that the user submits including name, email address and age to identify users and send notifications related to the use of the service. MySpace.com also collects profile information that users submit including gender, occupation, city, state and zip code and personal interests to facilitate member interaction.</p>
            <p>MySpace.com collects a limited amount of non-personally-identifiable information, such as IP address and browser type, from all users and visitors to the site. This information is used only for administration of the website, to improve services and for usage-tracking purposes.</p>
            <p>Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to people in a user's personal network, to support the function of the site as a networking community where users can meet new people through their friends. Email addresses are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed with people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on MySpace.com with each other through the MySpace.com service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, MySpace.com allows users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked.</p>
            <p>We may also use a user's email address to send updates or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their 'notification' setting to 'Do not send me notification emails' in the user 'Account Settings'.</p>
            <p>From time to time, MySpace.com or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. </font></p>
