                  Yes! Every feature and function you currently see on the site 
                  is FREE. MySpace is supported solely by advertising (the banners 
                  you see at the top of every page). In the future, MySpace may 
                  add paid Premium Services, but all the features and functions 
                  you have currently been enjoying on the MySpace site will always 
                  remain FREE!</font><br>

                  Adding color, graphics, and sound to your profile page is easy 
                  and requires only a basic knowledge of HTML (the programming 
                  language used to create web pages on the Internet). Simply go 
                  to &quot;Edit Profile&quot; and enter the desired HTML coding 
                  where appropriate.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you do not know HTML, you can reach out and make a new friend 
                  by asking someone who has color, graphics, and/or sound on their 
                  Profile page how they did it. People on MySpace are friendly 
                  and always willing to help, so just ask! This is a great way 
                  to meet new people! </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

                  MySpace is proud to operate as a FREE site to its membership, 
                  creating a great online community and providing a rich feature 
                  set for those within the community to interact with one and 
                  other. However, it is NOT free to develop and maintain MySpace, 
                  and therefore we rely on advertising dollars to support our 
                  efforts. The majority of mainstream advertisers refuse to advertise 
                  on websites with nudity, and simply put... no advertisers, no 
                  MySpace. So, if you enjoy the website and being part of this 
                  great community, please do not upload any nude pictures to MySpace, 
                  and if you have already uploaded nude images, please remove 
                  them. We thank you for your understanding and support.<br>

                  the experience will be for everyone. It's a fact, most people 
                  find new friends, dates, jobs, activity partners, advice, referrals, 
                  and just about everything else through friends. Therefore it 
                  just makes sense that the more you promote MySpace, the wider 
                  and more diverse of a personal network you will have access 
                  to. You benefit, and the entire MySpace community benefits. 
                  It's truly a win-win situation! So get out there and start promoting!
